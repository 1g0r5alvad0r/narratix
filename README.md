# narratix  
**see the story before the price**

the market doesn't move on truth.  
it moves on belief, fear, noise — stories.

some stories get dismissed.  
some get ignored.  
some move billions before anyone notices.

we notice.

narratix doesn’t show you charts.  
it shows you why they’re about to change.

no UI. no onboarding.  
just signal, silence, and spread.

---

this repo isn’t public.  
it’s just visible.

nothing runs here — yet.  
because the machine isn’t ready for you.  
and maybe never will be.

code lives elsewhere.  
logic lives upstream.  
access is earned, not granted.

**this is not:**  
- a tool for everyone  
- a dashboard for dopamine  
- a place to "join the community"

**this is:**  
- a system tuned to attention flow  
- an engine that detects divergence  
- a layer under the noise

**built by [homecloudhq](https://github.com/homecloudhq)**  
infra beneath the surface  
alpha beneath the price  
no gods, no dashboards, no drip

type nothing.  
fork nothing.  
watch if you know what’s coming.
